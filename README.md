# A simple Telegram bot

This is a simple Telegram bot created with the ![tutorial here](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Extensions-%E2%80%93-Your-first-Bot).  
Since the tutorial is done in interactive mode, I think a sorted script might help.  
**Do it by yourself first is strongly suggested!**

## config.ini

You have to create a file called 'config.ini'.  
It should contain:
```
[token]
key = {your-token}
```
And make sure you do not sync it to the Internet or anywhere that you cannot handle.
